<h3><center>Ngari Prefecture, Southern Route</center></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tibet, the real Tibet is to the west, in Ngari Prefecture. Ngari Prefecture is the ancestor of ten thousand mountains and the source of a hundred rivers. In the south of Ngari Prefecture, there is Kangrinboqe, a sacred mountain recognized by the four major religions, Lake Manasarovar, the head of the sacred Tibetan lake, the 100-kilometer Zanda Earth Forest National Geological Park and the 700-year-old Tsaparang. Let me take you to the heavenly Ngari Prefecture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Officially entered Ngari Prefecture in the sky, from Saga County through Zhongba County to Purang County.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a long journey today and we left at dawn.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunlight leaks down through the thick clouds, and the wonderful light and shadows are a beautiful picture at every turn.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, I saw black-necked cranes for the first time.The black-necked crane is on the world's endangered species list.It is the only crane species that lives on the plateau, and there are about 10,000 of them, about 80% of which live in Tibet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;At around 10:00, we crossed the Tumpla Pass at an altitude of 4920m into Zhongba County, the most remote county in Shigatse, Tibet, and Purang County in Ngari Prefecture to the west.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maquan River, the source of the Brahmaputra, gets its name from the mouth of a jet of water that resembles the neighing of a horse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not uncommon to encounter such scenes on the road: next to the sun shining is a downpour of rain.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When we arrived at Lake Manasarovar, we were surprised that there was an entrance fee, and there is no tram to the lake yet, so we decided to pass by Kangrinboqe and go to Ji WuTemple, which is located in the direction of Khor Township.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing by Kangrinboqe, I thought I could see Kangrinboqe from the JI WU temple as well, plus there was a special Kangrinboqe itinerary the next day, while the summit of Kangrinboqe was hidden in the clouds.
So without stopping much, we got off and took a few quick shots and moved on. We didn't expect that this was the only time we would see him on this trip.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kangrinboqe, meaning "Mountain of the Gods" in Tibetan, is the sacred spokesperson for Ngari Prefecture. It is also considered the centre of the world by Hinduism, Tibetan Buddhism, the native Tibetan religion of Bon, and ancient Jainism. Kangrinboqe, the main peak of the Gangtis Mountains, is only 6,656 meters above sea level, but its mountain form is unparalleled in its magic and natural beauty.
Kangrinboqe is a stable and sacred pagoda in every sense of the word, and the summit is covered with snow all year round. A huge trough of ice running vertically down the summit and a horizontal layer of rock form the "swastika", the Buddhist symbol of spiritual power and eternal dharma.

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaching JI WU Temple at about 5:30, we have a panoramic view of Lake Manasarovar.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake Manasarovar, Tibetan language meaning "eternal undefeated jasper lake". Climbing over, Lake Manasarovar shape like a full moon, the lake blue, blue waves lightly swing, white clouds and snow peaks reflecting which, the scenery is beautiful. Lake Manasarovar may be due to the stunning scenery, the proud geographical location, the spirituality of the dense flora and fauna, so it was given with all sorts of mysterious religious meanings, many religious books and legends have recorded and described Lake Manasarovar. Many religious texts and legends have described Lake Manasarovar. In the Buddhist classics, a lake was once called "the mother of the world's rivers", which means Lake Manasarovar.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The lake is teeming with waterfowl, while the mosquitoes are so big and plentiful that it feels like they could carry people away!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to bed late last night and woke up at 7:30 in the morning. I opened the curtain, and the long-lost sunshine, the Golden Mountains, appeared before me. Climbing onto the ledge of the room to capture the scene. This was the first time we had seen sunrise in so many days. I didn't know what kind of snowy mountain this was, but the beauty of her right now moved me. Holy crap, I think we've missed the sunrise over Kangrinboqe.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun on the mountains had lost its warm golden hue. Luckily there are still a few beams of golden light casting down from the clouds, illuminating the distant mountains in colorful, highland light, never stinting to make a stunning entrance, every time she turns around, leaving behind a charming moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;You will arrive in Zanda County around 4:00 pm, passing through the Zanda County Dirt Forest. The whole town is undergoing road construction and cars are passing by, creating a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;According to legend, tens of thousands of years ago, the area around Zanda County was a 500-kilometer-wide lake, a vast ocean. Is the Himalayan mountain building movement to make the lake basin rise, the water level is decreasing, the water surface of the rock lake bottom, the water, wind and rain long-term erosion is carved out of the present scene.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of square kilometers of earthen forest, full of scattered "mountain forest" shapes and forms, were spectacular. In fact, we only went past the tip of the earthen forest along the road, but we couldn't help but be amazed at the strange landscape we saw.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We unpacked our bags and took a short break before heading to the mysterious Tsaparang, 19 km from Zanda County on the south bank of the Elephant Spring River. It is said that with the collapse of the Tubo dynasty in the middle of the 9th century, some of the descendants of the royal family fled to Ali, and some of them established the Guge dynasty around the 10th century. By the 17th century, a total of 16 kings had succeeded each other, and at its peak, the dynasty ruled over all of Ngari Prefecture. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the Gug dynasty, which numbered 100,000 people, suddenly disappeared without a trace, for unknown reasons. The legends handed down by later generations, which are marked by fragments, contradictions and fabrications, not only fail to unravel the mystery of the mysterious disappearance of the Gughar Kingdom, but also add to its mystery.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruins are scattered with many caves, pagodas, towers and temples, with the palace at the top. Existing better temples, halls 5, temple residues have clay statues, many have been destroyed, but left behind the colorful murals, still beautiful, old and new, is the study of Tibetan history and the history of Tibetan architecture since the 10th century AD precious data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the inn, the innkeeper told us that there would be a very bright starry sky in the next few days, the most gorgeous at around 1:00 in the morning, and we fell asleep with anticipation.
<br>
At 12:30 pm, we went out to look at the sky, but the stars were visible in the thick clouds, so we couldn't care less, it was the first time we saw the starry sky in so many days.</p>

<h4>On 14 July</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;return to Barr Station from Zanda County by the same route to Senge Zangbu via the G219 national highway.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The team woke up early to catch the sunrise at Tsaparang and arrived at the bottom of Tsaparang Hill at dawn. We are waiting for the sunlight Guge dynasty.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then return to Zanda County and after breakfast depart for Senge Zangbu, the capital of Ngari Prefecture. After breakfast, you will travel to Senge Zangbu, the capital of Ngari Prefecture. You will pass through the deforestation again to reach the Zanda County checkpoint. Near the checkpoint, turn left and there is a road that also leads to Senge Zangbu.
<br>
The road is said to be mostly through the earthen forest and has a magnificent view, but it's under construction and the border control won't let us cross, so it's expected to open in the near future.</p>

<h3><center>Ngari Prefecture Northern Route</center></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the southern route, the northern route of Ngari Prefecture is more of an uninhabited wilderness. Desolate, vast, expansive, primitive, wild, and "wrong again and again". Often you can't see a single person for hours, but often you can see different kinds of wild animals on both sides of the so-called highway, most of which are Tibetan antelope, Tibetan donkeys and black-necked cranes. From the bottom of my heart, I don't want to have a highway to go through the wilderness, to keep the wilderness wild, or to be the right choice for mankind.</p>

<h4>15 July</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;from Senge Zangbu to Pangong Tso, sightseeing and return.</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langzhan/lvyou/%E7%8B%AC%E8%87%AA%E9%86%89%E5%80%92/66.png" alt="66">
<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pangong Tso is an international lake, with about two-thirds of its length and area in Ngari Prefecture in Tibet, China, and the remaining third in Kashmir. It is interesting to note that although the lake belongs to the same family, the one in China is fresh water and produces the endemic Tibetan splittail, while the one in India is brackish, bitter and undrinkable, with no fish growing in it.</p>

<h4>July 16</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ngari Prefecture north route across Chang Tang Nature Reserve started today, the first day is not easy, from Senge Zangbu via Gê'gyai County, Yajé Township to Rindo Township, the distance is 450km, most of the roads are bad.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chang Tang means "Northern Highlands" in Tibetan, which refers to the northern plateau of Tibet, located between the Kunlun Mountains, the Tanggula Mountains and the Gangdis Mountains, with an average elevation of over 4700 meters above sea level. Chang Tang Nature Reserve is one of China's five major pastures and one of China's four uninhabited areas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after setting out, I met a shepherd and his sheepdog, driving a large flock of sheep to pasture. The golden sun shone down on the man, the dog and the sheep, a beautiful and harmonious scene.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheepdog faithfully guards his flock, and sheep are indeed the best climbers of livestock, I'm convinced!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheep drifted away and we continued our journey. There was more and more wildlife on the road.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Tibetan antelopes, perhaps our arrival had disturbed them, turned their heads to look at us warily. Over a hill, a herd of Tibetan wild asses suddenly appeared in front of us, quietly scattered on the hills to graze, a rough estimate of hundreds of them.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rendo, shown as Xingsha Village on Google Maps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rindo Township is an important transit station on the Great Northern Route of Ngari Prefecture, measured at about 4950 meters above sea level, and is under the jurisdiction of Zhongba County. This is a typical Tibetan dwelling place, and I went there for a walk yesterday. The villagers are quite friendly, but very few of them speak Chinese. As it is located in a high altitude and cold area, the conditions are difficult. The hostel we stayed in is a one type of board room structure, but it is the best hostel here, fortunately there are public places nearby, and there is common water to wash.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon we arrived at Renqingxiubu Lake. At first we thought it was just a small, nameless lake, who knew that after half an hour of driving along the lake is still on the lake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The shepherdess and her flock drifted away beneath the snowy mountains and the lake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we didn't speak the same language, it didn't prevent us from having a pleasant conversation. Each of their smiles was so sincere and filled with happiness. We are all the same, we are all ordinary people living in this ordinary world, and I love this ordinary hard and try my best every day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The car left Renqingxiubu Lake and continued its journey. I think, just the scene by the lake, in a very long time will have been in my mind. The car in the uneven mountain road on the Mercedes-Benz, over a mountain pass, the scenery has changed again, there is an endless grassland, perhaps because the rain is not abundant enough, the grass is still slightly withered.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Groups of Tibetan wild donkeys could be seen everywhere, and our arrival didn't seem to bother them, they just looked up and looked around curiously.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Get to Lake Zabuye around 2:30 p.m. and continue along the lake without stopping.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake Zabuye, divided into South Lake and North Lake. The South Lake is a solid and liquid lake, covering 243 square kilometers, with a water depth of 2 meters and an elevation of 4429 m. The North Lake is a brine lake, covering about 100 square kilometers, with a water depth of several meters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake Zabuye is a lithium-rich salt lake, one of the three largest lithium salt lakes in the world, with the second highest lithium content in the world, and the first in China, and also has the highest cesium content in the world. Some travelers claim that Lake Zabuye is far more beautiful than the Chaika Salt Lake, so maybe we didn't find the right place or came at the wrong time.</p>

<h4>July 18</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;from Coqên County via Zhari Namco, Tangra Yumco to Vembunan village.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coqên , the Tibetan word for Great Lake, the sea. Coqên County is named after the Zhari Namco Great Saltwater Lake, which is located more than 10 kilometers away from the eastern part of the county.
 The average elevation of Coqên County is over 4700 meters above sea level, and it is a hilly and broad shoals type of landform. Coqên County is rich in livestock products and is one of the pure pastoral counties in Tibet and Ngari Prefecture. The county has vast grasslands, numerous lakes and abundant water sources.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after you leave Coqên County, you will see the blue of the sky and water, that is Zhari Namco.
Zhari Namco, the third largest lake in Tibet Autonomous Region, is a national famous wetland. It has an area of 1023 square kilometers, the lake surface elevation of 4613 meters above sea level, is an east-west length of nearly 54 kilometers, north-south width of about 20 kilometers of the large lake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We drove along the easy gravel road to Zhari Namco Lake.</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langzhan/lvyou/%E7%8B%AC%E8%87%AA%E9%86%89%E5%80%92/115.jpg" alt="115">

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I reckon this big black yak was the big devil of the herd, and he kept a deathly watchful eye on us as we took pictures, as if warning us not to move, or as if he was asserting his own devilish status.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As you continue along the lakeshore deeper into the Zhari Namco Lake District, the road is lined with occasional Tibetan donkeys and many unidentified water birds. After a small bridge, in front of a simple wooden house, and ropes to stop the road. I did not expect in this remote lake also set up a ticket office, but also the price is expensive, 120 ￥ / person.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The path became narrower and narrower, and before long we came to what looked like an observation deck.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The road ahead seems more and more twisting and difficult, full of unknown risks. After discussion, we decided to go back to the main road to Tangra Yumco.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The return car, we all said, this 120￥ spent the least value. After returning home, I carefully studied the Google satellite topographic map, and consulted the industry gurus, and decided to go along Zhari Namco, there are many roads ahead to connect S205 provincial highway, you can directly reach Tangra Yumco lake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of Zhari Namco is on the way, if I have the chance to go there again, I will definitely do it. This can't help but let me ponder: sometimes the eyes may not be real, only enough in-depth understanding, may understand the true like of things.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangra Yumco claims to be the most beautiful lake on the Great Northern Route, and it really is amazingly beautiful, but I wonder why the lake here is pink?</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hurried along the Tangra Yumco Lake and finally reached our accommodation for the day, (Wen Bu Nan Village) around 5:30 in the evening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangra Yumco is the oldest and largest sacred lake in Tibet worshipped by the Yogyakarta people and the fourth largest lake in Tibet.

There is a legendary kingdom that once stood on the shores of the Tangra Yumco and ruled over barbaric Tibet since prehistoric times - the Kingdom of Elephant Xiong.

So stretched for more than 10,000 years, until the eighth century A.D., only by the flourishing Tibetan dynasty overthrown. Today, the lake is still there, but the end of the once glorious dynasty is nowhere in sight.

You can't find a shred of credible evidence of this dynasty's existence, but it is rooted in the hearts and minds of every Tibetan in the region, just like Atlantis in the Western mind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The village of Wen Bu Nan is nestled beneath snow-capped mountains on the shores of Lake Tangra Yumco.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey continued over the mountains and reached Nyima County at noon. After a quick lunch in Nyima County, we arrived at Siling Lake at around 2pm.</p>

<p>  </p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the legend, Siling is a great devil who used to live in the west of Lhasa, in Dulong Deqing. He greedily devours tens of millions of creatures every day, including humans and all animals.

One fine day after a thunderstorm, Master Lotus Peanut, who had been fighting off demons all the way, finally found Siling.

Siling was no match for the Master.

With Master Lotus chasing after him, Siling fled to a vast, murky lake south of the Gangnee Qiang pond.

The Master ordered Siling to never leave this lake, to do penance in the lake and not to harm the aquatic species.

The lake was named "Siling Lake", which means "Siling Devil Lake".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the story is true or not, it is an irrefutable fact that Siling Lake continues to expand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to realize that I haven't taken many pictures all this way today, either because of physical exhaustion or aesthetic fatigue</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We arrived in Namtso around 3pm and checked into the Zazi Peninsula. Simply cope with the rumbling stomach, I went back to the room to take a nap, until the evening to come to the lake lounging.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky was gray, reflecting the lake, which had lost its thrilling blue color.</p>
