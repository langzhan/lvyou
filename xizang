<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone will ride with you to the four corners of the world, and someone will ride with you to Tibet."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a dream of Tibet in everyone's heart? It may have nothing to do with beliefs or obsessions, but it's just a habit of reciting it from study to work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2019 is probably the most exhausting year since work, always feel that should be a good, ritualistic end of the year, how to end it, then go to Tibet. I spent three minutes in a snap with my sister to decide on a travel location, took my vacation, booked my flight, and came up with this dream together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Writing about the hardships of Tibet is a pilgrimage in the spiritual sense of the word, with loneliness as the paper, experience as the ink, wandering in hand, a long journey, three steps and a long head."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as possible, a little bit of memories in Lhasa, put yourself in the vast and simple land and walk again.</p>

<h3>【Some issues】</h3>

<h4>1) Will there be a high altitude reaction in Tibet? (emphasis added!!)</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, more than 90% of people will have a high altitude reaction of some kind, and don't take it lightly (after all, I used to think I was an exception), but also don't be afraid to go into Tibet for fear of a high altitude reaction, after all, high altitude! Reaction is a very normal body reaction. We went from the plains to a plateau over 3,000 meters above sea level, and it is very normal for our bodies to be deprived of oxygen. So just set your mind at ease and relax.</p>

<p> </p>
<h4>2) What about having a high altitude reaction?</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I went to Tibet, I had two trips to the highlands. One was to Shangri-La and the other to Chuanxi, both by car (bus) . I got a bad cold in Shangri-La.... I was high on alcohol, manifested as a gastrointestinal cold, and had a fever for a day and a half (but took rhodiola for a week before going); then I decided on a whim to go to Chuanxi , slow and easy, no discomfort other than a bit of wheezing at the highest point. Don't jump around! </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, rhodiola really doesn't help, so don't buy any more, it only serves as psychological comfort. Some of the medications that can provide relief will be discussed later.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Back on topic, high altitude reaction symptoms have many kinds: breathlessness is the most direct manifestation of oxygen deficiency, may be accompanied by those days you are in the plateau, if only this situation, walk slowly, do not strenuous exercise on it. Then there is a headache, gastrointestinal discomfort, more serious will be fever, vomiting and diarrhea and so on. If you really feel sick, be sure to go to the hospital on oxygen, it really doesn't create dependency! We were on oxygen at the Tibetan People's Hospital the night we arrived.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also headaches, gastrointestinal discomfort, more serious fever, vomiting, diarrhea and so on, if you feel really bad, make sure to go to the hospital for oxygen, it really does not create dependency! On the night of our arrival, we were in the Tibetan People's Hospital for oxygen, 57 ¥ an hour, with a special oxygen room. It took almost an hour and a half, didn't make us pay any more fees, and the doctors were very nice and responsible, they said it was crowded in high season. The moment you breathe the oxygen, you are full of blood, really comfortable, my sister and I were like this the whole trip in the hospital . Also, pharmacies sell oxygen cylinders and some hotels provide oxygen (oxygen generators), but the hospital has the highest purity and most immediate effect, so I would recommend going to the hospital to get some relief when you are very sick and then have oxygen cylinders ready in case you need a refill. After all, if you're out for a short time, it's better to get your body back in shape as soon as possible.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4>3) How long will the high altitude reaction last?</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've read a lot of strategies that say the high altitude reaction symptoms will completely disappear after a day or two of acclimation, and I think it all depends on the person. Our high altitude reaction lasted until the night before we left, so the whole trip was a bit hard, but looking back now, it was worth it, and occasionally I wonder if I could have seen more of the beautiful scenery. Maybe all trips have regrets, so we'll save that for another time.</p>

<p> </p>
<h4>4）How do I get to Tibet?</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We're the plane to Tibet，You'll get altitude sickness.  。But flying has its advantages; the journey is more comfortable, less time consuming, and you can seek medical attention even if you experience discomfort in the middle of the journey.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many recommend the train into Tibet, the scenery along the way is indeed very beautiful, but it takes too long, and you will climb over several mountains midway, the road is quite bumpy, it is said that the second night is the toughest, and there is suspicion of boiling frogs in warm water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The most comfortable option is to drive yourself, as the altitude rises and you are free to arrange breaks, but you need a longer holiday (not for office workers) and the requirements for drivers are higher, as the mountain road is not so easy to travel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, taking the train or choosing to drive into Tibet is no guarantee that you won't experience a high altitude reaction.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4>5）Is it worth it to go into Tibet in the winter?</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tibet is different all year round and I think it's worth going whenever you decide to go, mainly depending on your time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The oxygen levels in winter will be about 3% lower than other seasons, and the temperature will be lower, but it's still about 10 degrees at noon in late December, so it's warm in the sun, and there's a big temperature difference between morning and night, so bring thick clothes. The advantage of winter is that there is almost no rain, and every day is sunny; then because it is off-season, there are fewer people, hotels are cheaper, many attractions do not charge admission, and you can see snow-capped mountains (and if you are lucky, you can see glacial lakes).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter in Tibet is pure, and the Tibetans walk with you on the warm streets. With sunrise at 8:30 and sunset at 7:00, the day is stretched out for a long time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest problem is that the lack of oxygen combined with the cold makes it a real challenge for the body if you then encounter a high altitude reaction.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4>6）How many days can I typically spend in and around Lhasa?</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lhasa is not a big city, so two or three days is enough. But also according to your own health and play time to determine, after all, if the time is long, in the sunny afternoon, walking aimlessly in the streets of Lhasa, or find a teahouse to drink sweet tea to laze, enjoy the slow life of Lhasa is also a very good choice ah.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lhasa The surrounding area, there are too many places to play it, if the same as we are free to travel partners, you can consider a few days tour group, according to their own needs to choose the right it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the different play time, you can choose a lot of routes, here is not listed it!</p>

<p> </p>

<h4>7）Should you choose to stay overnight when you go to the surrounding area?</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For some trips to see the sunset, the stars and the sunrise, or for big and small loops, there is the issue of overnight stays involved. Accommodations at the sites are nowhere near as good as those in Lhasa City, which may be fine in the summer, but not in the winter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, campsites are not provided in winter and Tibetan homes are provided instead, but after all, the habits are different and the homes are generally not heated in the more remote mountains and villages, and the winters are cold.Even if you burn cow dung to keep warm (yaks don't stink because they eat grass ha, the local driver told us).Most people should still be uncomfortable living there. Also, the high altitude and low temperature of the general accommodation can cause discomfort at night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;From our own experience, we sometimes don't sleep well in Lhasa due to altitude sickness, let alone in places with poor hardware. If you are not feeling well in the middle of the night, there is nothing you can do to alleviate it. So personally, I think, winter is better to report day tour group, day round trip will be better.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>【Some suggestions】</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.In Tibet, it is important to carry and keep your identity card with you, and there are security checks almost everywhere you go.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.If you are driving to Pumoyongtso and other attractions, remember to go to the border guard building for border guard card (seems to be nine o'clock to work), if you sign up for a group will generally be helped by local drivers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Within three kilometers of Lhasa city, the taxi starts at 10 ¥. This is what the local driver told us. This is what the local driver told us, and when I asked him how much when I got off, he told me not to ask for the price in Lhasa, and to give 10 ¥ within three kilometers. Because there may be cases where the driver will ask for the price (but we didn't encounter any in Lhasa hee hee, the people we met were all still very nice).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;4.Lhasa Gonga Airport is very small, after leaving the airport you can see the airport bus on the left, 30 ¥ per person. It's a good idea to take a regular taxi or dropshipping, as dropshipping in Lhasa starts at 15 ¥. It is recommended to take a regular taxi or dropshipping, the dropshipping in Lhasa starts at 15 ¥.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>【Preparation】</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;American ginseng tablets（It will help with energy, but I don't like the taste, so why not have some chocolate?  ）</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Glucose（It's also good for replenishing energy and relieving altitude sickness. It's available at Lhasa pharmacies at 15¥ a box.You can drink it straight, but it's better to mix it with water, otherwise it's too sweet）</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lbuprofen（It's great for headache relief, so have some on hand, but don't take it all the time.）
Gastrointestinal medication as well motion sickness medication can also be taken with you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Skincare：Sunscreen and moisturizer are a must for Tibet!Even in winter, the UV rays are strong in Tibet, so be sure to protect yourself from the sun. Also, the highlands are very dry, so in addition to your daily skincare routine, be sure to pack hydrating masks and moisturizing creams! Also remember to drink plenty of water (which can also help alleviate altitude sickness).</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>【Accommodation】</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The main place to stay in Tibet is Lhasa, followed by the surrounding attractions. Lhasa is a much better place to stay, with a wide choice of hotels, hostels, and homestays to choose from.It was a long struggle to choose a hotel, and I wanted to consider a more Tibetan-style homestay.However, taking into account the possible discomfort of the new arrival in Tibet such as lack of oxygen, low temperature, dryness, etc., we finally chose the more well-equipped (heating and support with humidifiers),The environment also looks like a newer hotel.This time we're staying in a hotel in Lhasa：平措康桑观景酒店Tibet Hostel (Potala Palace)。（(It's really not an ad).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fruits and Tibetan tea are served every day, glucose water was given to us on the first day when we had altitude sickness, and we got a free upgrade to a super view room, where you can see the Potala Palace from your room.</p>

<img src="https://b1-q.mafengwo.net/s15/M00/5C/78/CoUBGV5D5JeAb3IaAAy3yBCRoYw799.JPG" alt="2">
<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth floor of the hotel is a music bar, which is reasonably priced and comfortable, with night views of the Potala Palace from many locations.There will be a live singer at 8 or 9 p.m. If you come to Lhasa, you must go to the bar!</p>

<h3>【Gourmet】</h3>

<h4>【Tibetan cuisine】</h4>

<p>1.MAKYE AME—Located on Bharkor Street, it's one of the most popular Tibetan restaurants on the net. It's also very tasty, with many Tibetans and tourists.</p>

<p>3、巴扎yogurt，The shop we went to was on the negative floor of Shenli Plaza, a small counter. The plain yogurt was pure and very fragrant. I remembered to take photos only after I finished eating. </p>

<h3>【Itinerary】</h3>
<h4>（Arrival in Lhasa）</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are flying directly to Lhasa, the flight time is about 3h10min. into the Tibetan areas over the snow-capped mountains can be seen, a time can not find words to express my shock.</p>

<img src="https://n1-q.mafengwo.net/s15/M00/46/2A/CoUBGV4QrwiAX7o8ABAgW6P-j94002.jpg" alt="8">
<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at Lhasa Gunga Airport, the airport bus is on your left out of the arrival hall.Terminus Civil Aviation Authority.It's about 70min from the airport to the CAA.
It's important to note that from this point on you'll have to walk slowly, because altitude sickness can happen at any time... It could be headaches, stomach bloating, motion sickness, etc.</p>

<p> </p>
<h4>（Barkhor Street）</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The body was in much better shape than the day before, the headache was gone, but the stomach was still upset, so an easy trip was planned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving at Barkhor Street at 3 p.m., the street wraps around the Jokhang Temple, a place frequented by local Tibetans for sutra transfers.There are obvious signs to go through, and in winter there are fewer tourists, so you can see many Tibetans, just follow them.Barkhor Street is full of Tibetans turning sutras and kowtowing, there are many small Tibetan jewelry shops and sweet tea houses, and the Library of Paradise is also hidden here.</p>

<img src="https://p1-q.mafengwo.net/s15/M00/EA/11/CoUBGV5DnNaALQJlABFHcJDdaS8110.JPG" alt="9">
<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;At night Barkhor Street is illuminated and still filled with pilgrims and Tibetans.</p>

<p>  </p>

<h4>(Potala Palace, Barkhor Street)</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of the Potala Palace, painted with a mixture of honey, milk and paint, are spontaneously refurbished every year by Tibetans in and around Lhasa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is advisable to go to Potala Palace after a few days of acclimatization in Lhasa, as it is the highest elevation in Lhasa. There are many gentle and steep stairs, and it is very demanding.  </p>

<img src="https://p1-q.mafengwo.net/s15/M00/59/7C/CoUBGV5D4maANGbCAAvm4u--Wo8849.jpg" alt="12">
<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the off-season, there is no entrance fee to the Potala Palace, you can find a local guide, after all, we know very little about Tibetan Buddhist culture, 40 ¥ a person, and do not have to queue at the gate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering Potala Palace, you are not allowed to take photos inside, and it is closed at 3pm. The whole journey takes about two hours. The main reason is that I had a hard time going up, and I rested several times.</p>

<img src="https://b1-q.mafengwo.net/s15/M00/6F/DB/CoUBGV5D8bqAS6bjAAv4zkmU07k262.jpg" alt="13">

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan was to go to Jokhang Temple in the afternoon, but after leaving Potala Palace, I changed my plan and went straight to dinner... This time, we took a rickshaw ride through the streets of Lhasa, experiencing the excitement of the local market. Afterwards we went back to the hotel to rest, and at about 6pm we went to Jokhang Temple Square again.<br>
It seems like every day I go to Bharkor Street.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I went to the Paradise Time bookstore, which closes at 7:30, and at 7:00 the Tibetan guy in the store played the piano.</p>

<p>  </p>

<h4>（Yamdrok Lake,Lost in the starlight.）</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The off-season day trips are really cheap, only a hundred or so per person, if you only go to Yamdrok Lake, only 60￥. To go to Lake Puma Yumco is required to get a border security card, the lead driver will collect the ID card in the morning and go to the border building for processing, the whole process is fast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The drive to Yamdrok Tso takes almost two and a half hours, passing by the Yaluzangbu River at an altitude of 4280 meters.</p>

<img src="https://p1-q.mafengwo.net/s15/M00/F9/A9/CoUBGV4RbMyALkWlAA5HVGUMRLs94.jpeg" alt="17">
<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yamdrok Lake will stop at two places, one at the pass, where the sea wave tops out at 4998m, and then the lake. Sapphire is roughly the same.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, it's about an hour from the border station to Lake Puma Yumco. But! Our car broke down ... It's broken down in this deserted area where there's a lack of help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What followed was an endless wait, but the good news is that the tour leader was super helpful and kept busy fixing cars, contacting help, and calming the group down. The sun was shining, but as the day wore on and the temperature started to drop, some people were already uncomfortable because of the high altitude reaction. The good news is that I'm in a good frame of mind and just go with the flow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture below is the lonely back in the high altitude reaction state trying to struggle to walk for half an hour to find the toilet , really tired .......</p>

<img src="https://n1-q.mafengwo.net/s15/M00/48/2B/CoUBGV5D1bWAZuhxABHyLoLjzEc486.JPG" alt="20">
<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was about 6:30pm in Lake Puma Yumco. The scenery was really beautiful, the wind was really strong, and although the sun was shining, it was really cold and hard to breathe. I and sister get off to stay for three minutes, card rubbed a few how photos, efforts to the lake about ten meters to go into the car oxygen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that Namtso is even colder than here....</p>

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;At 8:30pm, we finally got on the road back to Lhasa, but the speed limit for driving at night was high, so the tour leader said we would arrive at Lhasa at about 1pm. Fortunately, the whole car was very friendly, and the mood was even higher than when we arrived, so we chatted and joked with each other, and didn't find the time too hard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, our tour leader suggested to take us to see the starry sky again, so we took a shortcut to a private observation deck, which is said to be a hotel with only one room.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When we got off the bus, we looked up and saw... I can't think of words to describe its beauty and shock, and no camera can capture the scene at that moment. The shining stars and the Milky Way seemed to be within my reach....
One of the guys in the team studied astronomy and pointed out many constellations to us. If it wasn't for the high altitude, I would have taken longer to see the constellations. Luckily we could see the stars along the way, so we finally arrived at the hotel at 1:30am.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4>（Jokhang Temple）</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I passed by Jokhang Temple almost every day, but every time I couldn't get in either because I was too weak or it was the wrong time. Finally today, I was able to visit the temple. Coincidentally, it was the 30th day of the Tibetan calendar, the first day of the first lunar month for us. Many Tibetans go there to pay their respects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two entrances to Jokhang Temple, one for Tibetans and the other for tourists. The route for tourists is mainly for sightseeing, and Tibetans are more likely to make a pilgrimage.</p>

<img src="https://b1-q.mafengwo.net/s15/M00/EB/CA/CoUBGV5DneiAYSAGABQxCZJgS08094.JPG" alt="25">

<p>  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the entrance of Jokhang Temple you will be asked if you would like a tour, so we hired a local tour guide for a total of ¥100 for two people. The tour was originally for four people, but the local guide didn't want us to wait too long, so he took us in when there were only three people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The local guide would explain the tour in more detail than the travel agent, and since he was a Tibetan himself, he was able to get a closer look at the Tibetan's piety and reverence for his faith.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We also saw many Tibetans from Qinghai and other parts of China, and the guide told us that we could tell by their clothes. Every year, many Tibetans come from all over the country to affix gold to the Buddha statues at Jokhang Temple at their own expense. If someone unfortunately dies, a tooth will be brought to Jokhang Temple by his or her companion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the explanations can't even be retold now, there must be a memory present.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recommended to go to Jokhang Temple and ask the person who gave the lecture for sure. You will get a different kind of impression and shock here. The whole tour will be over in an hour and a half.</p>

<h4>（Potala Palace,Yaowang Mountain of Lhasa,Zongjiao Lukang Park ）</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On our last day, we were on the 3pm flight back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we had been to Potala Palace before, we hadn't been to any of the surrounding attractions due to physical strength and time constraints. So we left at 9am to go to Potala Palace, Yaowang Mountain of Lhasa,Zongjiao Lukang Park. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Zongjiao Lukang Park is frequented by locals, including Tibetans who turn to scripture, as well as morning walkers and square dancers.There was a huge lake in the park with lots of ducks and mandarin ducks making all kinds of noises, and we watched them for half an hour.</p>

<p>Traveling doesn't really change anything, nor does it make any changes in life, but it can make us realize that there is such a way of life thousands of miles away, and it is also during the journey that we will understand that the world is more vast than we thought.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I always thought that it wasn't enough to understand life without reading, but when I grew up, I realized how I could read a book without experiencing it.</p>


<p>Maybe travel is one of those experiences that makes you understand something without you even realizing it.</p>


<p>When I first entered Tibet, altitude sickness followed me along the way, and with the short amount of time available, there was still a lot I didn't get to see.</p>

<p>I hear you can see the stars and the shining Milky Way at night from Everest Base Camp.</p>

<p>I heard Linzhi is full of peach blossoms in March and April. Go there next time.</p>

<p>I heard that the Ngari Prefecture Great Loop in Tibet is a paradise on earth and has the best stargazing spots in the world.</p>

<p>Some regrets were left, but there weren't really any, and a place this vast couldn't have been visited just once.</p>

<p>All of God's children are going to Lhasa.<br>


The child of God always comes back.</p>

<p>Finally, I hope that 2020 this epidemic passes sooner rather than later and that everyone is safe and sound. As with 2019, hopefully we will be able to go more places and see more different landscapes.✨～</p>
